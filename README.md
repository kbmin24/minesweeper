Simple console minesweeper written in VB.NET. Nothing more.

**NOTE**: Please don't expect a lot, because I wrote this in four hours when I was 16.

## Features
 * a working minesweeper
 * custom board size & # of mines

You should run this program from a shell like cmd or powershell, because this program will immediate close if you lose.
